- Azure Function and button in Admin UI to delete URLs
- Case-insensitive vanity look-up

### How to Update / Upgrade

You deployed the Azure Url Shortener and it's now running in your Azure Subscription, but you would like to have the new feature(s). Updating your current version is in fact really simple.  


#### Update the Azure Functions

Navigate to the Azure portal (azure.portal.com) and select the Azure Function instance, for this project.

From the left panel, click on the **Deployment Center**, then the **Sync** button. This will start a synchronization between GitHub and the App Service (aka Azure Function) local Git. 

IF you are using the Admin Blazor Website, repeat the same operation but selecting the App Service with the name starting by "adm".


## How To Use It

There is many different way to manage your Url Shortener, from a direct HTTP call to a fancy website. 
[See the complete list of admin frontends here](src/adminTools/README.md), with the instructions to deploy and use them. There is also instructions or [guidance](src/adminTools/README.md#how-to-add-a-new-frontend) if you would like to create a new one and collaborate to this project.
